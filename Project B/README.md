## Main Notebook Files
### Task1.ipynb
This notebook contains many sections that must be run from top to bottom to get proper outputs that are already visible.
All the code for questions 1-13 in Task 1 of Project B assignment are found in this notebook.

### Task2.ipynb
This notebook contains many sections that must be run from top to bottom to get proper outputs that are already visible.
All the code for questions 2 in Task 2 of Project B assignment are found in this notebook.

## Supplementary files Required:
- mhist_dataset folder containing all the images are required (Based on: https://bmirds.github.io/MHIST/)

## Python Libraries Required:
